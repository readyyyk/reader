    *   **Belarusian:** The text does not provide a list, but prompts the reader to conduct their own survey to identify topical issues for Belarusian youth.
*   **How to build a path to problem-solving:**
    *   The text provides a six-step strategy for problem-solving:
        1.  Identify the problem.
        2.  Brainstorm possible solutions.
        3.  Evaluate the outcome of your problem-solving process.
        4.  Think about why it is a problem.
        5.  Put the solution into action.
        6.  Evaluate the solution to the problem.
*   **How to solve youth problems:**
    *   **Materialism:** Fill life with activities other than shopping, or do something to help others.
    *   **Substance abuse:** Talk to a counselor, academic advisor, or career counselor.
    *   **Failure to succeed in education:** Seek help from an advisor to connect with resources at college; work hard with a friend or group.
    *   **Racism:** Receive support from others who have experienced such trauma, as well as from family and the community.
    *   **Offending/destructive behaviour:** Requires early intervention, and if warnings are not heeded, Parenting Orders and Anti-social Behaviour Orders may be used.
*   **Role of a family in a teen’s life:**
    *   Single-parent households face difficulties, especially with tough economic conditions.
    *   Parents can influence the situation by talking to their children.
    *   It is suggested that teens talk to their parents about their problems, showing integrity and maturity.
    *   Parents and mentors should be involved in early intervention for destructive behaviour.
*   **Why the problem shouldn’t be hidden:**
    *   Ethan's letter shows that lying to parents about problems (like not attending college) leads to feeling tired and wanting to stop.
    *   Dustin's reply suggests that talking to a specialist (counselor, advisor) is the first step, as you are not the first student to lose motivation.
    *   Showing parents you have a plan (YOUR OWN PLAN) can make the conversation go more smoothly.
    *   Honesty is a sign of integrity and maturity.

    *   **Community:** Technology use can impact individuals and communities with dangerous consequences. The text notes that US teens interact approximately nine hours per day with digital media.
*   **Reasons for becoming tech and Internet addicted:**
    *   **Randomised rewards:** Apps and devices deliver rewards on a random schedule, keeping users hoping for the next validating message or "like".
    *   **Endless sources of information:** Scrolling has no breaks, and apps like Instagram keep users checking back.
    *   **A sense of connection:** Technology promises a sense of belonging and community, playing on the primal fear of isolation.
*   **Positive and negative sides of the Internet and technology:**
    *   **Positive:** The text acknowledges that for many, these changes will not lead to addiction. Technology is a basic tool for trading, entertainment, communication, and education.
    *   **Negative:**
        *   It can become an addiction with dangerous consequences.
        *   Leads to multitasking, which is correlated with poor cognitive and mental health outcomes.
        *   Shortens attention spans and impairs the ability to focus.
*   **How to avoid tech and Internet addiction:**
    *   **Do an assessment:** Use an app like Moment to measure tech use and set goals for cutting back.
    *   **Institute tech breaks:** Deliberately schedule time for tech use and set alarms for tech-free periods.
    *   **Establish tech-free zones and times:**
        *   Institute a no-tech policy during meals.
