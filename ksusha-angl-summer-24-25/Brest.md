Brest is a city situated in the south-west of Belarus, neighboring Poland and Ukraine. It serves as a principal border crossing linking the European Union with the Commonwealth of Independent States. The city’s name may have originated from Slavic words for "birch bark" or "elm," or a Lithuanian word for "ford." According to a legend, a merchant saved from a bog by birch branches founded the settlement of Berestye.

In the 11th century, Berestye was an ancient Russian trade centre and fortress. It became one of the largest cities in the Great Duchy of Lithuania and, in 1390, was granted the right of autonomous administration. Belarus's first printing house was founded in Brest in 1553. During the 20th century, the city was part of Poland for almost 20 years before it was consolidated with the BSSR in 1939.

Today, Brest is one of the largest economic and cultural centers of the republic. Its industrial enterprises produce items like electric stoves, furniture, and clothes. The "Brest" Free Economic Zone, established in 1996, promotes innovative business and investment with foreign capital. The city’s success is attributed to its advantageous location, infrastructure, and skilled population.

The educational system is well-developed, comprising numerous schools and two universities. For recreation, Brest offers many sports facilities, including the Ice Palace, the Rowing Canal, and stadiums. The Brest Fortress is a major historical symbol, founded in 1836. It gained universal fame for taking the first blow of the German attack in the Great Patriotic War. The garrison fought under unbelievably hard conditions for over a month, becoming a symbol of heroism and endurance. Today, the "Brest Hero-Fortress" memorial complex is a major tourist sight.

Another significant landmark is the Brest Millennium Monument, erected in 2009. It presents a group of bronze statues depicting an angel, historical figures, and abstract images central to Brest's history. Near the city lies the unique Belovezhskaya Pushcha, the largest virgin forest reserve in the region. This reserve is famous for its rich wildlife, including 55 species of mammals like the East European aurochs. The forest's museum and animal enclosures attract tourists from all over the world. The city also features other places to visit, such as museums, theatres, and historic architectural landmarks. These include several Orthodox and Catholic cathedrals and the Brest Central Railway Station, dating back to the 19th and 20th centuries.

# Original

Brest surrounded by a large greenbelt is situated in the south-west of the Republic of Belarus, neighboring with Poland and Ukraine. Its territory covers 72.9 square kilometers, about 326 thousand people live there. Being situated on the main Berlin-Moscow railway line and international highway, Brest became a principle border crossing since World War II. Today it links the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent states.

There are several theories of the city name origin. The most common are as follows. The name of the city comes from: a) the Slavic root "beresta" meaning birch bark, b) the Slavic root "berest" meaning elm, c) the Lithuanian word "brasta" meaning ford.

Different legends exist about the foundation of Brest. According to one of them a Russian merchant who travelled with his caravan in the west, had become stuck in the bog. He covered the way for himself with branches of birch-trees and managed to reach the river bank. Grateful for his wonderful rescue he built a chapel in this place. Later people settled here and called their settlement Berestye from the word "beresta" meaning birch-bark.

In the 11th century Berestye was an ancient Russian trade centre and a fortress, which was situated on the cape formed by the Western Bug River and by the left branch of the river Mukhovets. The development of the city foundation was facilitated by its favourable location on the border with Polish and Lithuanian lands. In the 14-16th centuries Berestye was one of the largest cities in the Great Duchy of Lithuania. In 1390 Berestye was among the first Belarusian cities given the right of autonomous administration under the Magdeburg Law. In 1553 the head of Berestye, Radzivil Chorny, founded the first printing house in Belarus.

During the years of World War I Brest-Litovsk was occupied by German Troops. On March 3, 1918 the Treaty of Brest was signed in the White Palace. Beginning from 1921 Brest-Litovsk, being a part of Western Belarus, was annexed by Poland for almost 20 years. On September 22, 1939 the western part of Belarus was consolidated with the BSSR and Brest became the centre of the region. According to the agreement of the Yalta Conference of February 1945, Brest's status as part of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was officially recognized. Now it is part of the independent country of Belarus.

Brest today is one of the largest economic and cultural centers of the republic. There are industrial enterprises in the city. Among them we can mention the Electric Test Equipment Plant, The Electric Bulb Plant, the Chemical Goods Plants, the Knitted-Wear Factory, Joint Venture "Brestgazoapparat" etc. Our enterprises produce electric and gas stoves, furniture, carpets, knitted-wear clothes, foodstuff.

In 1996, at the start of qualitative economic transformations, the first Free Economic Zone was established in the Republic of Belarus. The "Brest" FEZ has become a territory of new possibilities for innovative forms of business management and implementation of promising investment projects with foreign capital.

There is a variety of valid reasons why Brest was specifically chosen as the first place for innovative activities, namely: advantageous geographical location on the EU border, easier access to the CIS/EU markets, close location to automobile, railway, river and air communication routes, availability of production areas with well-developed transportation infrastructure and, last but not least, people with high level of education, professional skills, creative initiative.

The educational system comprises 77 nursery schools, 35 secondary schools, 6 gymnasiums, and 2 lyceums. Young people study at vocational and training schools, at Brest State Pushkin University and Brest State Technical University.

There are several sports centers, the Ice Palace, the Rowing Canal, the Sports Manege, the Palace of Water Sports, stadiums, indoor swimming pools and outdoor sports facilities.

The location of the city at the crossroads of the whole Eurasian continent is a good basis for progress in all spheres of life and for the development of durable and perspective international relations. The Russian Federation, Ukraine and the Republic of Poland consulates, which are located in Brest, actually promote cooperation between the people of the countries.

The Brest Fortress over the Bug has become a symbol of the eternal glory of the Soviet Soldiers. It was founded on June 1, 1836. The Citadel is the main fortification of the fortress. It is not merely a remarkable military construction; it is an interesting architectural complex.

The Brest Fortress got universal fame during the Great Patriotic War because it took the first blow for itself. The courage of the soldiers of the fortress will always be in the memory of our descendants. At the dawn June 22, 1941 (Sunday), Hitler Germany launched its perfidious attack against the Soviet Union without declaring war. Hitler had counted on the "Blitzkrieg": he expected to rout the Soviet Army Forces in a short period of time.

The garrison of the Brest Fortress had to fight under unbelievably hard conditions. The small fortress area of just four square kilometers was steadily shelled by hundreds of guns while planes with swastika on their wings showered it with bombs. The garrison was short of ammunition, medical supplies and food. They were cut off from the water, which had to be fetched under enemy fire.

The defense lasted for over a month. The fortress walls were tumbling down, the bricks melted and the very earth was scorched, but the fortress stood undaunted. The Nazi command was outraged. The Hitler forces mounted one attack after another, sustaining heavy losses, but they were powerless to crush the fighting spirit of the fortress defenders.

The Brest Fortress became one of the sacred monuments of the Soviet people, a symbol of its heroism and endurance, a living example of patriotism. The memorial complex "Brest Hero-Fortress" erected on the site is a tribute commemorating the immortal exploit of its garrison. Today the Brest Fortress is the major tourist sight.
