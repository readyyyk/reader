Some graduates work as accountants, which is one of the most prestigious and widely required professions for an economist.

It is important not to mix up the role of an accountant with that of a bookkeeper. A book-keeper is mostly involved in calculations, such as balance sheets and income statements. An accountant, however, is responsible for designing the financial policy of a company. Other graduates find employment at banks, at the Stock Exchange as brokers, or work for the government and military services. Having mastered the economic laws of society, the student hopes to make a contribution to solving problems facing their Republic.

**THE PROFESSION OF AN ECONOMIST**

I'm a student of the Department of Economics at Brest State Technical University. In the near future I'll graduate from the University and become a professional economist. I'm sure that the profession of an economist is among the most important ones and plays a crucial role in upgrading the national economy of this country.

What makes a good economist? Whatever he does, an economist should have an in-depth training in economic theory, mathematics and statistics and our University offers such training. At the University we are taught various general and special subjects, such as Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, Management, Accounting, Marketing, Advertising, Money and Banking, Economic Theory, Econometrics, Statistics, Computer Science, Philosophy, Business Ethics, Foreign Languages, etc.

An economist needs some knowledge of the world outside his own country because both business and government are deeply involved in the world economy. The insight into political and economic history will help him to expect changes and always look for basic long-run forces under the surface of things.

The profession of an economist is quite diversified. The graduates of our department work at educational institutions, various research centres and laboratories, in industry, business, banks, etc. You may continue your studies at the Post-graduate Courses or Doctorate if you have a desire and abilities to become a scientist or a professor. Scientists in the field of Economics develop new theories and models, test their hypotheses and carry out economic research.

Being employed in industry and business, our graduates work as managers in different spheres - as executive managers, sales managers, financial managers. Some of them work as accountants. An accountant is one of the most prestigious and widely required professions of an economist in any society. You shouldn't mix an accountant with a bookkeeper. While a book-keeper is mostly involved in calculations, like balance sheets, income statements, invoices, an accountant is responsible for designing the financial policy of a company.

Some of our graduates work at the banks, at the Stock Exchange as brokers, others work for the government or are employed by various agencies and by military services.

Having mastered the economic laws of the development of society, economists can solve many problems facing our Republic and I hope I'll manage to make my contribution to this process.
