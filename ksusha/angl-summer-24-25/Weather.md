How much do you know about the United Kingdom? The first thing that comes to one's mind is the weather. It is boring, isn't it? British people don't like it because of its changeability. This feature makes it distinct from the rest of the world. But there are still many interesting facts that make the UK a unique country.

There is an important thing we should know about the UK. Officially the country's name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but sometimes the name Britain is used to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole. The United Kingdom comprises four geographical and political parts: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. London is the capital and the largest city of the country. It is among the world's leading commercial, financial and cultural centers. Other major cities include Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Belfast, Leeds.

The territory of the country is surrounded by water, having only one land border with Ireland. The United Kingdom is separated from the continent by the English Channel. The country occupies an area of over 242,000 sq km and has a population of over 67 million (2019). The United Kingdom covers most of the British Isles, a collection of over 6,000 islands of which Great Britain is the largest. England, Scotland and Wales occupy the island of Great Britain. Northern Ireland occupies the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland.

The main factor influencing the weather of the British Isles is their position close to the ocean. It means that the UK receives a large amount of rain. On the whole the country has a temperate climate with generally cool temperatures and plentiful rainfall all year round. Atlantic currents warmed by the Gulf stream bring mild winters, and British summers are cooler than those on the continent. In general the weather in the UK is often cloudy and rainy, and high temperatures are infrequent. In addition the weather conditions are extremely changeable. The English sometimes say you can't plan your day because every moment it can start to rain.

The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. The current monarch and the head of the state is Queen Elizabeth II. The monarch undertake various official and representational duties. At the same time the government runs the country. The head of the government is the prime minister (PM) who is the leader of the majority political party. The British Constitution is not based on a single document, it is only partly written and is flexible. Its basic sources are parliamentary legislation and law decisions. That's why the country is often said to have an unwritten constitution.

The British Parliament often referred to as the "Mother of Parliaments" is one of the oldest legislatures in the world. It consists of the monarch, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Parliament is the legislative body of the United Kingdom and the primary lawmaking institution.

The work of the two houses of Parliament is similar: making laws, checking the work of the government, discussing the current issues. Nevertheless the House of Commons often called simply the Commons is more powerful as it decides which laws will be discussed and passed. The House of Commons is publicly elected from the four political divisions that make up the United Kingdom. The UK voters elect 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) to represent their interests in the House of Commons.

The House of Lords often called the Lords is the second chamber in the UK Parliament. It is made up of around 800 members. They are not elected. The role of the Lords is generally recognized to be complementary to that of the Commons.

The two main political parties in the United Kingdom are the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. Since 1945 eight general elections have been won by the Conservative party and six by the Labour Party; the great majority of the members of the House of Commons have belonged to one of these parties. The Conservative Party developed from the old Tory Party which began in the late 1600's. The Labour Party began in 1900. Much of its support comes from trade unions.

The Liberal Party is the third significant party, but it has never received enough support to form the national government. It is much smaller than either the Conservative or the Labour Party.

The party which wins most seats at a general election usually forms the government. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of this party. The Queen appoints the Prime Minister after each general election. As the head of the Government, the prime minister selects the Cabinet, choosing its members from among those in Parliament who generally agree with his intended policies. The largest minority party becomes the official Opposition with its own leader and the "Shadow Cabinet". The leader of the Opposition is elected by his or her fellow party members.

Major segments of the British industry include energy, mining, manufacturing and construction. One of the strongest components of the British industry is the energy sector. The United Kingdom is a net exporter of energy. In addition to oil, the Kingdom has abundant reserves of natural gas, coal, and atomic power. Most of the kingdom's energy resources are concentrated in the North Sea.

The UK has a strong manufacturing tradition that goes back to the origins of the Industrial Revolution. In the XIX century the UK was a world leader in producing key materials associated with the Industrial Revolution: coal, steel, textiles, steam engines and ships. The most important manufactured products today are machinery, fuels, chemicals, food, beverages, tobacco. The UK is also the major supplier of vehicles, aerospace products, electrical and electronic equipment. The country is responsible for 10% of the world's export of services, including banking, insurance, stockbroking, consultancy and computer programming. The main export partners are The USA, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain.

Agriculture in The UK is today intensive, highly mechanized and efficient, producing about 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. Around two thirds of production is devoted to livestock, one third to arable crops. The livestock products include poultry, cattle and sheep, milk, meat, eggs and wool. Farmers grow wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, oilseed rape and sugar beets. British farming corresponds to the world's tendencies in agriculture: farmers have to adopt more environmentally friendly methods such as organic farming. It does not use artificial chemicals that can damage the environment and human health. There are several types of farming practiced in the UK: arable farming (growing of crops and cereals), pastoral farming (rearing and production of animals) and mixed farming (the combination of arable and pastoral farming). There is also market gardening which is the production of fruits and vegetables.

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is one of the most powerful nations and strongest economies in the world. It occurred to be among the world's first industrialized countries.
